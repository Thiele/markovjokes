# Markov joke generator
A script that generates jokes from different sources. Depends on [markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify), installable with pip.

The sources are stupidstuff.json, wocka.json and reddit_jokes.json from [this repository](https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset), and the script expects the files to be placed in the same directory as the script.

The script generates a new json-formatted file, generated_jokes.json. A sample of generated jokes can be found in [generated_jokes.json](generated_jokes.json).
