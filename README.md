# Markov joke generator
A script that generates jokes from different sources. Depends on markovify, installable with pip.
The sources are stupidstuff.json, wocka.json and reddit_jokes.json from [this repository](https://github.com/taivop/joke-dataset), and the script expects the files to be placed in the same directory as the script.

The script generates a new json-formatted file, generated_jokes.json. A sample of generated jokes can be found in [generated_jokes.json](generated_jokes.json).
